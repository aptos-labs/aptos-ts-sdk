/**
 * TransactionWorker provides a simple framework for receiving payloads to be processed.
 *
 * Once you `start()` the worker and push a new transaction, the worker acquires the
 * current account's next sequence number (by using the AccountSequenceNumber class),
 * generates a signed transaction and pushes an async submission process into the
 * `outstandingTransactions` queue. At the same time, the worker processes transactions
 * by reading the `outstandingTransactions` queue and submits the next transaction to
 * chain, it
 * 1) Waits for resolution of the submission process or get pre-execution validation
 *    error and
 * 2) Waits for the resolution of the execution process or get an execution error. The
 *    worker fires events for any submission and/or execution success and/or failure.
 *
 * @example
 * ```TypeScript
 * import { Aptos, AptosConfig, Network, Account } from "@aptos-labs/ts-sdk";
 *
 * const config = new AptosConfig({ network: Network.TESTNET });
 * const sender = Account.generate();
 *
 * const worker = new TransactionWorker(config, sender);
 *
 * // Register a handler for some TransactionWorkerEvents
 * worker.on(TransactionWorkerEventsEnum.TransactionExecuted, (data) => {
 *   console.log(`Transaction executed successfully: ${data.transactionHash}`);
 * });
 * worker.on(TransactionWorkerEventsEnum.TransactionExecutionFailed, (data) => {
 *   console.log(`Transaction execution failed: ${data.error}`);
 * });
 *
 * // Push a transaction to the worker
 * worker.push({ function: "0x1::aptos_account::transfer", functionArguments: [recipient.accountAddress, 1] });
 *
 * // Start the worker. You can await this Promise if you'd like to handle any errors
 * // that may occur with the worker's internal tasks.
 * worker.start();
 *
 * // Keep pushing transactions as long as you like while the worker runs.
 * worker.push({ function: "0x1::aptos_account::transfer", functionArguments: [recipient.accountAddress, 1] });
 *
 * // Once you're done, you can stop the worker.
 * worker.stop();
