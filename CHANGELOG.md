# Aptos TypeScript SDK Changelog

All notable changes to the Aptos TypeScript SDK will be captured in this file. This changelog is written by hand for now. It adheres to the format set out by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

# Unreleased

- Respect `API_KEY` option in `clientConfig` when making indexer and/or fullnode queries
- [`Added`] Added `waitForIndexer` function to wait for indexer to sync up with full node. All indexer query functions now accepts a new optional param `minimumLedgerVersion` to wait for indexer to sync up with the target processor.
- Add `getSigningMessage` to allow users to sign transactions with external signers and other use cases
- [`Breaking`] Changes ANS date usage to consistently use epoch timestamps represented in milliseconds.
  - `getExpiration`: Previously returned seconds, now returns milliseconds
  - `registerName`: Argument `expiration.expirationDate` was previously a `Date` object, now it is an epoch timestamp represented in milliseconds
  - All query functions return epoch milliseconds instead of ISO date strings.
- [`Breaking`] Flatten options for all functions to be a single level
- Cleanup internal usage of casting
- Export `AnyPublicKey` and `AnySignature` types
- Add `transferFungibleAsset` function to easily generate a transaction to transfer a fungible asset from sender's primary store to recipient's primary store
- [`Breaking`] AccountAddress.fromRelaxed is now AccountAddress.from, and a new AccountAddress.fromStrict has the old functionality.

## 0.0.7 (2023-11-16)

- Adds additional ANS APIs

  - Transactions
    - setPrimaryName
    - setTargetAddress
    - registerName
    - renew_domain
  - Queries
    - getPrimaryName
    - getOwnerAddress
    - getExpiration
    - getTargetAddress
    - getName
    - getAccountNames
    - getAccountDomains
    - getAccountSubdomains
    - getDomainSubdomains

- [`Breaking`] Refactor transaction builder flow
  - Each builder step is under a dedicated namespace - `aptos.build.transaction`, `aptos.sign.transaction`, `aptos.submit.transaction`
  - Supports and implements 2 types of transactions - single signer as `aptos.*.transaction` and multi agent as `aptos.*.multiAgentTransaction`
  - A boolean `withFeePayer` argument can be passed to any transaction `build` function to make it a Sponsor transaction
  - Different functions `aptos.sign.transaction` to sign a transaction as a single signer and `aptos.sign.transactionAsFeePayer`to sign a transaction as a sponsor
  - Return `InputSingleSignerTransaction` type changed to `SingleSignerTransaction` type
  - Return `InputMultiAgentTransaction` type changed to `MultiAgentTransaction` type

## 0.0.6 (2023-11-14)

- [`Breaking`] Changed `ViewRequestData` to `InputViewRequestData`
- Respect max gas amount value when generating a transaction
- Added a clearer error message for when the typeTagParser encounters a possible generic TypeTag but generics are disallowed
- Update all dependencies to the latest version
- Added ability for providing own output types for view functions

## 0.0.5 (2023-11-09)

- [`Breaking`] Update and changed the flow of Fee payer transaction to be "Optional Fee Payer". A fee payer is now required to sign the transaction `asFeePayer`
- `getAccountEventsByEventType` query uses new `indexed_type` indexed field to avoid rate limit
- [`Breaking`] Rename `TOKEN` to `AUTH_TOKEN` for better visibility
- Set the `AUTH_TOKEN` only for faucet queries

## 0.0.4 (2023-11-03)

- [`Breaking`] Changed all instances of `AccountAddress.fromHexInput` to `AccountAddress.from` to accept AccountAddress as well
- [`Fixed`] Fixed a bug where an entry function with only signers would fail due to type tag parsing
- [`Fixed`] REST API errors now properly give error messages in JSON rather than just `BadRequest`
- All address inputs now also accept AccountAddress
- Support derive account from private key `Account.fromPrivateKey()`
- Derive account from derivation path secp256k1 support
- Default Account generation to Legacy Ed25519
- Remove unnecessary pre-emptive serialization of the field `rawTransaction: Uint8Array` by replacing it with the unserialized `rawTransaction: RawTransaction` class
- ANS (Aptos Names Service) SDK initial support for creation and lookup of names
- Initial Auth key rotation support

## 0.0.3 (2023-10-31)

- Remove MoveObject in favor of AccountAddress, use AccountAddress for Object inputs
- Use revamped parseTypeTag function instead of StructTag.fromString()
- Allow use of generics in parseTypeTag
- Rename publishModuleTransaction to publishPackageTransaction and fix functionality accordingly
- Added toString() for type tags, and reference placeholder type
- Add ability to generate transactions with known ABI and remote ABI
- Fix verify signature logic
- Implement `MultiKey` support for multi authentication key

## 0.0.2 (2023-10-25)

- Build package before publishing\
- Add `AccountAddress.ZERO` to support the frequent future use of an optional fee payer address

## 0.0.1 (2023-10-25)

- [`Breaking`] Changed all instances of `arguments` to `functionArguments` to avoid the reserved keyword in `strict` mode.
- Support publish move module API function
- Fix client config not being added to the request
- Support to config a custom client instance
- Changed all Regex based inputs requiring a `0x` to be optional. This is to allow for easier copy/pasting of addresses and keys.
- Change GetAccountResource to take in a generic output type that matches the struct
- Add support for Single Sender

  - Support for orderBy keys type checking for indexer queries
