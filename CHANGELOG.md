# Aptos TypeScript SDK Changelog

All notable changes to the Aptos TypeScript SDK will be captured in this file. This changelog is written by hand for now. It adheres to the format set out by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

# Unreleased

- [`Breaking`] Updated `AccountAddress.fromString` and `AccountAddress.from` to only accept SHORT strings that are 60-64 characters long by default (with the exception of special addresses). This can be adjusted using `maxMissingChars` which is set to `4` by default. If you would like to keep the previous behavior, set `maxMissingChars` to `63` for relaxed parsing.
